This repository is a big mess at the moment. As I work through this documentation process, I expect to tidy it up and provide better workflows for actually testing the code, but if you're seeing this now, please be patient.

This repository contains all the code for running the "Large Transaction Model" as part of the CRAFT grant project of the same name. The code comes predominantly from the paper FATA-Trans, which was not an easy code base to build upon in my opinion. There are parts of the code that are objectively very ugly and perhaps that I don't even fully understand.

In the process of adapting FATA-Trans code for my own data, I tried to simplify the code base by getting rid of a lot of unnecessary things. For instance, FATA-Trans had borderline duplicates of every dataset file, because one of them was for IBM data and one was for Amazon data. I've tried create more generic dataset classes that can better handle transaction data generically. FATA-Trans also did a fair amount of ablation testing, which of course is good, but as a result the FATA-Trans code base included lots of slight variations on their datasets and models for ablation testing of different parts of their architecture. I've tried to pare down what's in the code base to primarily include just the TabBERT and FATA-Trans models.
